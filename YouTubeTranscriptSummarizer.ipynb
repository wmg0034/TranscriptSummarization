      "Hello and welcome to spirit island, in about three minutes. Its a game for one to four players. It has a solo mode. Playing time is approximately 30 minutes per player This is a complex game Imagine if you would that youre a peaceful water spirit in a remote Pacific paradise. Your days are spent talking to fish, making it rain, and being prayed to by the locals. Then one fateful day. European colonists turn up and start clear cutting forests, damming the rivers and polluting your waterways. How would you respond? With flash floods and mass drownings of course. That is spirit island. Cooperative: each player controls their own spirit and plays together against the invaders. area control: each Spirit has tokens that represent their influence on the board and where they can use their powers. card management: each player has a set of cards that represent the powers they can use. Powers are discarded once used winning the game initially the only way to win is to remove all invaders from the board. This is exceptionally hard. But fear is the key to victory, you must make the invaders fear you when you destroy a town or city you create fear. many spirit powers also create fear. Fear increases the terror level, and when the terror level goes up the type of invaders you have to destroy get fewer and fewer. Making victory easier. play a turn choose growth actions for your spirits such as gaining power tokens and placing presence on the board. play cards and use powers. some cards are fast and will hit the colonists before they act. But many are slow. Fear cards cause negative effects on the invaders The invaders expand across the island making a mess. slow cards now take effect Refresh and begin a new turn Spirit island is a brain burner of the game every turn will have a lot of difficult decisions for you to make. There are multiple different spirits and they all play differently but perhaps most importantly they synergize with each other differently, leading to a lot of combinations of powers. This spirit is a slow and steady builder who helps to defend places from attack. while this spirit specializes in scaring people. Combine this with the large decks of available powers and you have a game that will never play the same way twice. Scenarios and different invader groups allow you to adjust a difficulty to suit your style freely. The single best thing about this game is when youve been fighting against the invaders for a while now, and your spirit is growing in power, so you decide to get a major power upgrade. Then your eyes light up when you see something awesome in your hand. You keep quiet until someone says \"how do we deal with this coastal city?\" and you reply \"well I could always summon a tsunami\" but there are reasons you might not like this game its complex and that can cause a lot of information overload and analysis paralysis. its not casual gamer friendly and I would only recommend it to people with a fair bit of experience with modern board games for the same combination of hard decisions, card management and excellent solo gameplay I recommend mage Knight \n"
